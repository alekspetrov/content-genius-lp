As we all know, AI-powered content generation tools have changed the way we create content. However, many users still rely on traditional prompt collections, which often limit the full potential of these amazing tools. So, let's explore what is Prompt Framework and see how it can change the content generation game for you.

But first, you need to know, the better your prompt the better results you get from the GPT model. This is why it is so important to create your prompts, for your unique needs and stop using prompt collections.

## The Limitations of Prompt Collections

Prompt collections are a curated set of questions or statements that help users get started with AI-generated content. While they can be helpful, they often come with a few drawbacks:

**Limited scope.** Prompt collections can only cover a limited range of topics and ideas. This means they may not cater to your specific requirements or niche.

**Lack of flexibility.** Prompts are often rigid and leave little room for customization, which can lead to generic or repetitive content.

**Inefficient.** Searching through a list of prompts can be time-consuming and may not guarantee the best results.

To overcome these limitations, it's time to switch to Prompt Framework.

## What is Prompt Framework?

Prompt Framework is a more structured and sophisticated way of organizing prompts. It allows users to create more targeted and precise content for their specific needs.

Prompt framework is like a set of instructions for the GPT model what it should think about. For a human it is a better way to represent what he expected as an output from the model. Software for developers like JIRA or Asana use the structured forms to create a ticket, because developers must have a good understanding of what exactly they are building. The same concept works for ChatGPT.

### The RCG Framework in Content Genius

The RCG framework consists of three components Role, Context and Goal. These components makes prompt flexible but structured at the same time.

#### Role

Defines the role an AI assistant should follow (e.g., tech blogger, marketing advisor, etc.).

#### Context

Provides context around a task or issue (e.g., software features, target audience, etc.).

#### Goal

Sets a clear objective for the AI-generated content (e.g., inform, persuade, entertain, etc.).

Why it is important to make a prompt structured? Well GPT was pre-trained on a huge dataset. This means that it will generate the answer from the global domain of knowledge, if no constraints are set. Here is RCG Framework comes into play, it set constraints and now the model focused on the context but still uses the full power of the dataset.

By using the RCG framework you can craft more focused and relevant content that suits your unique requirements. Look on the following examples to get a better understanding how RCG looks like.

---

**_Tech Blogger_**

**Role**\
Act as a professional tech blogger.

**Context**\
SaaS product with specific features.\
Features:_\<your product features>_.\
Target audience: _\<your target audience>_.\
Focus: _\<anything you need to focus on>_.

**Goal**\
Write an engaging blog post promoting the SaaS platform for the target audience.

---

**_Marketing advisor_**

**Role**\
You are a marketing advisor working for a marketing agency.

**Context**\
A new product launch. _\<your product description>_.\
Features: _\<your product features>_.\
Target audience: _\<your target audience>_.

**Goal**\
Create eye-catching social media posts to generate buzz and get audience attention.

---

Here you can see the context related to the exact product, and the goal is associated with the context. The AI produces content that aligns with these requirements, ensuring a more effective media post than just regular.

For comparison check out the prompt from the prompt collection available over internet. The prompt is called "Social Media Influencer" and has the only sentence “Act as a Salesperson to convince clients to sign up for a subscription to my YouTube channel”. This prompt tells nothing about the context of the GPT model, who are “clients", what is the “YouTube channel“about, and how should it hook people without that knowledge? The result of such a prompt is unpredictable and useless.

## How Content Genius Utilizes Prompt Framework?

Content Genius uses its own very specific approach. Instead of creating uncontrolled threads, Content Genius comes with custom assistants each follows the RCG framework and keeps the context through conversation. They are available in chat UI like your contacts in messages.

## Can I Use Prompt Framework in Regular ChatGPT?

While Prompt Frameworks offer numerous benefits, they may not be compatible with regular ChatGPT interfaces that do not have the necessary system prompt form, thus restricting the functionality.

You can use regular prompt input, but it does not work the same as the system prompt that sets the context for the discussion. Note system prompt should be passed with each request to work properly. So the answer is no, you can’t use the framework in regular ChatGPT UI.
