We're excited to announce the Alpha release of Content Genius, a cutting-edge AI-powered content generation platform. This release marks the beginning of our journey to revolutionize the way you create content and save time.

In this Alpha release, we've introduced several key features and enhancements designed to help you generate quality content faster and more efficiently:

### Chat GPT

The core feature of Content Genius is its ability to generate content using OpenAI's ChatGPT by creating specified assistants. Each assistant follows the frameworks we call RCG (Role, Context, Goal). You may have noticed that ChatGPT loses context after several prompts, and you need to remind it of the topic of your discussion and what you expect to get. Now, you don't need to repeat yourself. Content Genius utilizes system prompts to do so, which means you need to specify your context only once.

_Chat features:_

- Markdown support
- Syntax highlighting
- Remove messages
- Clear history

### 20 Pre-configured Assistants

We've included 20 pre-configured assistants, each designed for specific content creation tasks, such as writing speeches, crafting newsletters, and developing educational materials. These assistants will help you streamline your content generation process and improve the quality of your output. Check the content in prompts to understand how to customize them.

More assistants are coming next week.

### Customizable AI Assistants

Personalize your AI assistants to better match your unique writing style and preferences, resulting in more tailored content output. Create new assistants from the chat page or add from the collection and customize them later.

A blog post on how to use assistants is on the way!

### Notes

Notes are a great way to store insights from the chat for future editing. Use collections to organize your notes by topics. Star them to see them in the Featured folder.

Notes also have syntax highlighting for code blocks.

### Dark Theme

Dark theme included to keep your eyes relaxed.

### Looking for feedback

We're excited to have you on board for this Alpha release, and we look forward to your valuable feedback. Together, we'll refine and enhance Content Genius to become an indispensable tool in your content creation toolbox.

Thank you for being a part of the Content Genius journey!
