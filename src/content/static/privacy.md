You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting our support team or updating your preferences in your account settings.

## 7. International Data Transfers

Content Genius operates globally and may transfer your personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of these countries may have different data protection laws than those in your country or may not have data protection laws at all.

When transferring your personal information outside the EEA, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data. These safeguards may include:

Transferring data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission.

Using specific contracts approved by the European Commission, known as Standard Contractual Clauses, which provide the same level of protection for personal data as it has within the EEA.

Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EU and the US.

By using our services and providing us with your personal information, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your personal information in countries outside your country of residence, including countries outside the EEA.
